I have a burning passion for developing innovative, performant, and cutting-edge applications with detail. Including different types of backends, web, and mobile applications alongside secure and efficient computing. I also have an eye for accessibility.

Before I started writing code, I spent my time playing video games and figuring out how computers work piece by piece by building them.
